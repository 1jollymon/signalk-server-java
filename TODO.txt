Make sure streaming behaves:
    ws://hostname/signalk/v1/stream?subscribe=self ws://hostname/signalk/v1/stream?subscribe=all ws://hostname/signalk/v1/stream?subscribe=none 
	With no query parameter the default is self, which will stream the data related to the self object. all will stream all the updates the server sees and none will stream only the heartbeat, until the client issues subscribe messages in the WebSocket stream.
	If a server does not support some streaming options listed in here it must respond with http status code 501 Not Implemented.
